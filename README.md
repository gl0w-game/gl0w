gl0w / a game for #GGJ2017

Yes, you got it: this game is all about flowing. Our little energy ball will always try to ride the wave that matches its color. To switch to another wave, hit the space bar to adjust your color and wait for the next intersection! Different waves have different speeds, and give you different scores as well. Going past the lower and upper bounds, energy balls are consumed by the universe (a.k.a. game over). The longest you can stay flowing on the screen, the greater your score will be! Hints: Try to move without touching the green wave for bonus points!
